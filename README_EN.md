### Usage

Changing `item-models.yml` in Slimefun folder is required to use this resource pack. It will NOT work if you only load resource pack in your client.

You will get two files inside the zip archive, one with `.zip` extension is the resource pack, the other one is `item-models.yml`.

Replace `/plugins/Slimefun/item-models.yml` with the new one, restart your server, Bingo!

Now use the resource pack, and you are all set.
